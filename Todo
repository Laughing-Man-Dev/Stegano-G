# ToDo  

Change getPubkey() [finger print]

Rework imageProcessing()  [function commented in popup.js or the one you were testing outside project]
Rework downloadImage()
Rework Stamp

Add Sign Function to helper.js out of keypair.js
Add JSDoc style documentation. And maintain that habit. Comment HTML sections.
Add error handling
Add console.log() to all utils/ and popup.js (for future use in background.js)
Update code to use repeatable eventlisteners handlers [imageProcessing, downloadImage]
Think about DOM management/loading/unloading [Wait until the DOM is fully loaded before running script, Ensures all elements are accessible]

Clean out any unsed code.
Format and clean JS & HTML. Move excess code out of popup.
